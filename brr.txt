Hey. so this is the survival period of my life. I must become a programmar or i may die like Hamlet. I liked Peter Norvig [1] article on programming. 
He states that it takes the 10000 hour priniciple to become really good in this field. 
Similar to all other fields. Similar idea is porposed by Malcolm Gladwell in his book [2], that the key to success lies in two things: environment and work ethic. 
An agent must have the ecosystem that helps you in your goal. then you work hard to achieve the goal. Our major focus is to systematize the method to learn 
any language. the first thing to learn is semantics (meaning of terms) and syntax (construct). this is broad as their are many keywords and verstatility of 
the language structure. then you need to devlop algorithmic thinking. to think like a computer. this requires practice. 

one of the first thing i learned was to convert pseudocode to java. there is level of similarity between languages which allows one to convert to another.
